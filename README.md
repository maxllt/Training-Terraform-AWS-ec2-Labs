# AWS EC2 Labs with Terraform

Welcome to the AWS EC2 Labs repository! This repository serves as a collection of hands-on labs focusing on deploying EC2 instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform. These labs are designed to provide practical experience with infrastructure as code (IaC) and AWS services.

## Labs Overview

Each lab in this repository focuses on a specific aspect of deploying EC2 instances with Terraform. You'll learn how to set up security groups, subnets, SSH access, VPCs, and internet gateways to deploy, manage EC2 instances effectively and more to come.

## Getting Started

To get started with a lab, navigate to the respective lab directory. Each lab directory contains a `README.md` file providing instructions specific to that lab. Additionally, you'll find both French and English versions of the README in `README_fr.md` and `README_us.md` respectively.

## Prerequisites

Before starting any lab, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of AWS services
- Familiarity with Terraform (version 0.12 or higher)
- An AWS account with necessary permissions to create EC2 resources, security groups, subnets, VPCs, and internet gateways

## Notes
